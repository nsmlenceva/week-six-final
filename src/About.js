            The desire to win back a place for harmony and peace from the chaos of life is the main idea that pervades all our projects. We strive to rethink the space for the content and perfection of each of its elements. Here you will not find excessive embellishment and avoidance of meaning, from function for the sake of form.
            Creating a project begins with working with light. It is light that sets the basic forms of space, reveals textures and creates an atmosphere. Other important elements are laconic volumes, natural materials, clear geometric contours of objects, freedom and flexibility of composition. We call this style cozy minimalism.
            Outwardly very simple, it is built on a subtle play of nuances. Demanding and requires an ideal sense of proportion, does not tolerate excess. But it gives the space freedom, integrity, a sense of comfort and tranquility.</p>
